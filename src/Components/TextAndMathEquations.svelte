<h1 class="body-header">What makes two players similar?</h1>
<p class="body-text">
Following the 90s Bulls dynasty, many players were touted as the “next 
Michael Jordan.” This title proved to be both a blessing and a curse for 
many young talents. For every player like Kobe Bryant who could live up to
the title of the “next Michael Jordan,” there were 50 more who couldn’t. 
Still, before we decide if Ant can be considered a contender for the “next
 Michael Jordan,” we must first define what makes two players similar. For 
 this comparison, we will access a few major talking points. First, we will 
 start with basic stats. You can’t be the “next Michael Jordan” if you can’t 
 put up the same insane numbers night after night. Next, we will move on to 
 shot selection. Jordan was known for being a mid-range monster, shooting 
 iconic fade-aways and gravity-defying dunks. We will access MJ’s and Ant’s 
 shot selections and compare them to see their similarities. Finally, we have 
 intangible features like handshake and physicality. Michael Jordan was one of 
 the most athletic guards ever to play. If we want to say Ant is the “next Michael 
 Jordan,” he should be similar in athleticism. In the end, we hope to take these 
 three major factors and use them together to frame a compelling argument as to 
 why or why not Anthony Edwards is really the “next Michael Jordan.”
