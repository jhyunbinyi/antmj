To compare their impact, we created a bar chart that visually represents the points per game (PPG) averages of Anthony Edwards and Michael Jordan during their first four years in the NBA. The chart showcases how Michael Jordan consistently outscored Anthony Edwards in their respective early careers. Jordan's higher scoring averages, especially in Years 1, 3, and 4, highlight his dominance in mid-range shots, while Edwards' lower but progressively improving averages reflect his focus on three-point shooting and shots closer to the rim. Interactive tooltips provide additional context, such as the normalized data option, which adjusts for their percentage of team points scored, offering a deeper comparison of their scoring efficiencies relative to their eras. This visualization is crucial in our project to understand the scoring patterns and efficiencies of both players, illustrating the significant differences in their playing styles and their impact on the game during their early careers.
