To analyze the similarities between Anthony Edwards and Michael Jordan, we developed a comprehensive shot chart using D3.js within a Svelte framework, utilizing data from the nba_api. This shot chart visualizes and compares the shooting patterns and efficiencies of both players by plotting their shots on a scaled basketball court. Interactive elements, such as tooltips, provide detailed shot information, including distance from the rim, quarter, and time remaining. The visualization highlights the distinct differences in their playing styles: Edwards emphasizes three-point shooting and shots closer to the rim, while Jordan dominated mid-range shots.
